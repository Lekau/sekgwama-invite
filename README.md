## Sample Issue Template (copy for each ticket):
```

**Title:** Scaffold Login BLoC and Placeholder UI

  

**Description:**

Set up the Login feature using Flutter BLoC pattern. Include empty state, event, and bloc classes. Create a basic login form (UI placeholder only) with navigation to OTP and PIN entry placeholders.

  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- /features/auth/bloc/ with login_bloc.dart, login_event.dart, login_state.dart
    
- /features/auth/views/login_page.dart
    
- Simple form with “Member Number”, “ID”, “Password” (no logic yet)
    
- Navigation to OTP and PIN placeholder pages
    
- All business logic marked as TODO
    

```
---

## Notes
- All business logic and API integrations to be added **after design handoff**.
- Please keep code clean, documented, and modular per BLoC and feature-first best practices.
- Check in with the team on any architectural or package decisions before finalizing.
